# Buster

Your friendly neighborhood Discord bot.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Take a look at the README in the project you would like to edit ( [bot](./packages/bot/README.md) | [web](./packages/web/README.md) ) for further details on how to work on that project.

## Releasing

1. Do a version bump with `npx lerna version`
   - See the [semver docs](https://semver.org/#summary) for more information on how to bump the version.
   - This will _push_ the tag and commit, so don't tinker around with this if you aren't doing a release (speaking from experience :D)
2. TBD
